# Overview

This is a simple tasks manager that I built in C++. I chose to build a task manager because i've built similar projects in other programing languages so I better understand what I need to do and when coding in a new language I like to keep some things familiar. This allowed me to really learn C++.

I was able to use classes, constructors, methods, vectors, conditional statements to help me build this task manager. This task manager can successfully add, view, remove, and mark tasks as completed. I added a little point system because I thought it would be fun and thats something I would like to explore more in the future.

One of the things I enjoyed the most about C++ was relearning about public and private access modifiers. I learned this previously in a object oriented programming class and I like the concept of how this can better secure the code. 


# Development Environment

I completed this project in Visual Studio Community although I also played with it in CLion from JetBrains because i've heard so many people talk about how much they love JetBrains.

I used these libraries
 - #include <iostream> : for reading and writing from console
 - #include <vector> : for storing data in a vector
 - #include <string> : for strings

# Useful Websites

This is the main website I learned C++ on.
- [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)
- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)

# Future Work


- Make the point system based off difficulty of the task
- Add a task due date or deadline in which it need to be compeleted by
- Load tasks from file / save tasks to file
